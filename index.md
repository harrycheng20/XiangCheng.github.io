# Welcome

Hi, I am a second-year Computer Science PhD student in Virginia Tech since Fall 2018. My research interests include deep learning, security and data mining , especially in *interdisciplinary applications of security and deep learning*. 

Before that,I got my bachelor degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and University of Glasgow (UoG). During my undergraduate years, I got the **excellent graduate** title from UESTC and Sichuan Province Government.  I was also awarded the **National Scholarship** (China's highest-class scholarship for the top 1% students) for **Twice**. 

 If you are interested in me, you can find my **[CV](./assets/CV/English CV of Xiang CHENG.pdf)** here.
