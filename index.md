# Welcome

I am a second-year Computer Science PhD student in Virginia Tech since Fall 2018. I am advised by Prof. [Yaling Yang](https://www.faculty.ece.vt.edu/yyang8/index.html) and Prof. [Young (Yang) Cao](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~ycao/). My research interests include network security and privacy, secure localization, and machine learning. 

Before that,I got my bachelor degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and University of Glasgow (UoG). During my undergraduate years, I got the **excellent graduate** title from Sichuan Province Government and UESTC.  I was also awarded the **National Scholarship** (China's highest-class scholarship for the top 1% students) for **Twice**. 

 If you are interested in me, you can find my **[CV](./assets/CV/English CV of Xiang CHENG.pdf)** here.
